# Sefirot

עשר ספירות בלי מה נעוץ סופן בתחלתן  
ותחלתן בסופן כשלהבת קשורה בגחלת  
שאדון יחיד ואין לו שני ולפני אחד מה אתה סופר  

עשר ספירות בלימה בלום פיך מלדבר  
ולבך מלהרהר ואם רץ לבך שוב למקום  
שלכך נאמר והחיות רצוא ושוב  
ועל דבר זה נכרת ברית  

_Ten emanations without form._  
_Their end is also their beginning, just as the ember is tied to the flame._  
_The Master is unique and without peer, the one and only._  
_And what number do you place before one?_  

_Ten emanations without form._  
_Restrain your feelings and silence your words._  
_Do not stray from the path, lest you free the beasts._  
_Upon this a covenant was formed._  

_— The Book of Formation, 1:7-1:8_  

## Details for all levels
- The smell of dried mud and decay.
- Words are carved above a doorway describe the room's spiritual value.
- Each room has a specific auditory tone.
- Each room is cut from solid rock into a precise hexagonal shape.

## Upper Level
### 1. The Pedestal (**The Crown**)
- The walls are unpainted and marred with broken clay, as if purposefully left unshaped.
- A beautifully-wrought statue of a broken circle stands on a pedestal in the center of the room. The light reflecting off the sculpture is so reflective it causes temporary blindness if stared at for too long.
- The sculpture appears to face the viewer no matter where in the room they stand. A series of mirrors are positioned in each corner create the illusion; the object's true location is high up in the ceiling.  
- The **South** exit is blocked by a wall of brackish mud nearly 8 feet high. Halfway up there is a hole large enough to fit two arms through. The tunnel beyond appears dark. The lettering on top is smudged and broken.   
- To the **West** is an exit with no carvings above the doorway, but beyond the tunnel walls are lined with a swirling maelstrom of letters covering nearly every inch, with no conceivable meaning. It leads to the  to the **Workshop**.
- The tunnel **East** leads to the **Courtyard**. The archway above contains the symbol of a closed eye. It smells of dead flowers; the sounds of rushing water echo throughout.
- Stairs from the **North** ascends to the **Schul**.

### 1a. Central Tunnel (**Knowledge**)
- The walls are painted a dull gray.
- MORE

### 2. The Workshop (**Understanding**)
- The walls are painted blood red; the room smells like smoke and sweat.
- A workshop crammed with desks and tools. Some of the tables are filled with miniature, half-built attempts at creating a golem.
- It is difficult to move around without pushing the furniture around (and making a lot of noise in the process).
- A highly detailed human brain is skillfully etched onto the cavern wall. Below the diagram is a small bucket filled with grubby water and some drawing tools.
- Stairs on the **South** side go to the **Outer Chamber**
- On the **South-East** side is staircase going down to the **Lower Level** (see the **Treasury**).

### 3. The Courtyard (**Wisdom**)
- The walls are painted blue-black.
- In the center of the room is a bubbling fountain, making a pleasant bubbling sound.
- The statue's middle is obscured by wilted vines. Removing the plants reveals that the statue has both male and female genitalia.
- In the fountain's basin are three large stones, shaped into smooth ovals. They are eggs left by the **Alukah**; they will hatch soon, then spread onto the surface. They are slightly warm.
- In the **South-West** corner is staircase going down to the **Lower Level**, exiting into the **Treasury**. The archway is imbued with carvings of wealth and excess.
- On the **South** wall is a water vein large enough for a person to crawl through, single-file. The shaft leads to the **Burial Chamber** . There are no markings around it.  

### 3a. Water Vein  
- A muddy corridor that dips gradually into the **Lower Level**, exiting into the **Burial Chamber**.

- Wooden poles & parchment

### 5. The Burial Chamber (**Grace**)
- The walls here are painted white.
- A 10-foot long platform is installed into the earth. A massive Golem lies flat and lifeless on the table. Its forehead has smudged lettering on it.
- Four wooden arms are attached to the platform and enclose the body. Careful observation will reveal that they are all right-arms.
- A shaft on the **North** side brings water into the room from the **Courtyard**, where it splits into three smaller conduits that line and bisect the room, each ending in identical 2-foot wide shafts on the **Southeast** corner. The water flows from here into the **Pool of Life**.
- **Engine Room**
- **Splendor**

## Bottom Level
### 6. The Pool of Life (**Kindness**)
- The walls here are painted a very light blue.
- Three small shifts pour water from the **Courtyard** into a large pool of fast-moving water in the center.
- Glinting within the waters is [treasure], next to a large wooden carving of a man, his feet rooted to the muddy ground.
- The water from the pool changes flesh to wood and earth.

### 7. The Shrine (**Glory**)
- The walls here are painted a very dark orange.
- A large tapestry hangs on the **West** wall. It depicts a great bonfire; bodies are burning within. Some are clearly human, but others look monstrous. A crowd of children is watching.
- Getting close to the tapestry reveals that it generates intense heat; touching it causes 1d4 STR damage.

## Questions

### Multiple Entrances/Exits
- One entrance is beneath a rotating platform in the **Schul** (the pedestal)
- Another entrance via the **Orphan's Mound**

### Consider why it was built in the first place
- At the founding of the town, nearly 100 years before.
- Originally used as an underground tomb for the town's deceased; additionally a vault was built to house the town's wealth later expanded to deal with the great numbers of corpses resulting from the Dawn Plague thirty years before.
- Originally designed to keep townsfolk away from the hidden wealth; later to prevent Ghouls from raising the dead.

### Ideas
- Trap: an obvious painting on the ground/wall of whatever trap is behind it. Pressure tears the canvas, triggering the trap.
- False wells
- Head wires above tombs
- Powders that are inhaled
- Failed golems
- mercury addiction
- ??? The tunnel walls are painted yellow, blue, pink, violet, white, red, orange, and gold. ???
