# The Dawn Plague Bestiary

### Dybbuk (those that cling)
10 HP,  12 STR, 14 DEX, 15 WIL, elongated claws (d6), jagged teeth (d8)
- Appear as gray-skinned, translucent humanoids with long snouts full of large, ugly teeth. Cannot interact with the world while in spirit form.
- Can leap into the living to wreak havoc among the living. Grows more powerful the longer it maintains a bodily presence.
- Critical damage: target is immobilized and unconscious. If the body is not healed via a ritual prayer, the victim becomes a host for the Dybbuk.

### Root Witch
8 HP, 9 STR, 16 DEX, 14 WIL, tuber-fingers (d6)
- Excellent tunneler that hides underground near water. Wiggles tiny fronds into the air as lures.
- Above-ground, appears vaguely humanoid with the face of a rotted tree stump.
- Will exchange rare minerals for a “fresh corpse” of any kind.
- Easily takes offense, especially if offered anything more than a few days dead.
- Critical damage: target is pulled underground, where they soon suffocate.

### Shtekn Folk
4 HP, 1 Armor, 11 STR, 8 DEX, 14 WIL, knotted fists (d8+d8)
- Stick-like humanoids made of branches, vines and roots. Refer to themselves as "the People".
- Never leave the **Blue Forest**. Regularly eavesdrop on "Flesh Folk" through tree-linking.
- Will trade almost anything for information they don't already have.
- Can approximate speech through undulating their twig-like fingers.
- Attacks utilizing fire are _enhanced_ against **Shtekn Folk**.

### Zina (an Estrie)
10 HP, 11 STR, 15 DEX, 14 WIL, draining hair (1d8)
- Appears as a woman with long dark hair that extends all the way to her feet. Can transform into an owl at night.
- Drinking blood gives her power, but she can also obtain sustenance from eating bread and salt if taken from one she has wronged.
- Binding their hair prevents any transformation. Can be killed, but her head must be buried and the mouth stuffed with dirt.  
- Critical damage: target falls unconscious for 1d4 days.

### Shabriri, the Dazzler
- Lives in pools and water
- Defeated by speaking one letter less of his name at a time while walking backwards, until it disappears, e.g.Shabriri, habiri, abriri, briri, riri, iri, ri.

### Golem
16 HP, 2 Armor, 15 STR, 6 DEX, 2 WIL, cobblestone fists (d10)
- A hulking 9’ tall statue made of clay, mud, and prayer.
- Mindlessly follows whatever commands given by its master, even after their death.
- Immune to mundane blades and missile weapons. Damage from fire is _enhanced_.
- If destroyed, the Golem eventually reforms and carries out its previous orders.
- Uttering the inverse of the spell that created it reduces the Golem to mud.

### Alukah
- Leech
- No shadow
