# The Dawn Plague Overview

## Summary
- See the overland [map](/wip/the-dawn-plague/maps/the-dawn-plague-map.jpg).
- **Motal** is a small village seated between a thick forest and a restless sea.
- Devastated by something called "The Dawn Plague" decades before, the town has never fully recovered.
- The villagers keep to the old ways, carefully following ritual burial rites.  
- An outside lumber company has planted its stake in the local forest, and pays the town handsomely.
- Workers and their families have arrived, bringing with them their religion and customs.
- “Strange sightings” have raised tensions between the villagers and the new families.
- **Rab Schlomo** and his congregation have resorted to an ancient practice meant to protect the town from both outsiders and potential threats. Their efforts may have summoned a far worse threat to the town, with dire consequences.

## The Dawn Plague
- Thirty-three years ago, a hunting party from **Motal** found themselves lost in the **Blue Forest**, eventually taking their rest in a place haunted by bodiless Dybbuks. By morning, all were possessed.
- The newly-bodied Dybbuks then found their way to the village of **Motal**, retreating back to the forest after wreaking havoc on the frightened populace.
- The locals were ill-equipped to handle the situation. A small group of all able-bodied adults attempted to stop the Dybbuks on their own turf. All but one (**Zina**, a seamstress) did not return.
- An Estrie (see **Zina** below) nesting nearby observed the Dybbuks from on high, seeing that they could only possess a body while the spirit slept. She also saw that their _hated_ fire. She let one of the children know what she'd learned, then moved her nest to the **Blue Forest**. She feels great guilt for not helping the townsfolk further.
- The remaining residents (mostly children and the elderly) were able to chase their possessed  neighbors & parents with torches and flaming brands, forcing them into a nearby barn. They then set it ablaze, killing the bodies but freeing the spirits trapped within. This place is now referred to as **Orphan’s Mound**.
- Today the locals still stand vigilant for a full night after any burial, to ensure that none are possessed by a Dybbuk. They endlessly repeat the phrase, “A candle for one is a candle for a hundred.”
- An oath of secrecy was soon invoked, whereby a lie would be told from that day forward: a disease killed the older citizens of **Motal**. Breaking this taboo would result in expulsion from the community. One of the children became **Rab Schlomo**, and made great efforts to forestall such a harm happening ever again.

## Hooks
- PCs are hired by a wealthy outsider, sent to quiet the unrest.
- The PCs stumble upon the town in their travels, just as workers and villagers are coming to blows. A local clergy or city official may ask for their assistance as outsiders.
- Rumors of abandoned treasure buried beneath a large burial mound not far from town.

### Evidence of Dybbuks
- Disturbed graves; mutilated animals. The sound of rocks moving in the forest.
- A gangly figure dressed in ragged clothing, seen only from afar.
- Last seen at the small abandoned cemetery North of town. Reports are unreliable.

### Last Culling
- A holiday marking the end of Fall as well as the final harvest.
- Locals remember those they'd lost during the **Dawn Plague**, and what they had to do to survive afterward.
- They eat dried unsweetened cake and attend services at the **Schul**.

## 1. First Light
- The oldest established homestead. Home to an elderly sisters who lost family to the **Dawn Plague**
- They trade mostly in candles. Some have magical or warding properties.
- A **Dybbuk** haunts the farm, but will not touch the sisters. They are its former children.

## 2. Shorehead Ruins
- A large, mostly worn-away temple that predates the arrival of the **Motal** colonists.
- Some theorize they represent ancient sea-faring peoples from across the **Silver Sea**.

## 3. The Tentyard
- Three structures lined in rows along the beach. They look like the ribs of a massive sea creature.
- A tarp is draped across one of the ribs. In the shade below, **Aroys-Geben** makes his home.
- He lives off fish and whatever trade he can find. He is also a spy for both the **Meyster** and **Gehilts**.

## 4. Motal
- A dozen rustic-looking wooden buildings form a perfect square in the center.
- A massive old-growth forest dominates the lands to the East, split by a small mountain.
- On the North side dozens of farms spill out along a long, dusty road. The road bends Northwest.

### Optional Hook
- When the PCs arrive, a group of 10 locals (identifiable by their drab clothing) are about to come to blows with 5 obviously foreign lumber workers.

### Meyster's Office
- A box-like wooden building that was clearly renovated quite recently. Carefully studying the facade reveals it was formerly a butcher's shop.
- **Meyster Zeydne** often naps here at lunch; otherwise the place is usually empty.
- The room is bare save for a small desk and comfortable chair. The desk is shut with a simple lock.
- Within is an unsigned document detailing an agreement that would hand over management of the village to the **Gehilts Lumber Company**. The signer would receive 20% of future lumber profits.
- The symbol of protection (an eye) is emblazoned on the surface of the drawer, beneath the paperwork.

### The Schul
- The oldest building in town, standing in stark contrast to the newer construction.
- The ground before the doorway is sprinkled with white flour. If a demon crosses the threshold, its footsteps appear as if a chicken made them.
- The temple within is musty and in dire need of repair. Dual rows of broken wooded seats line a cracked central causeway, which ends at a small stone platform taking up much of the opposite half.
- In the Southwest corner is an attached study where **Rab Shlomo** studies as well as sleeps.
- A mechanism in the study controls the stone platform, causing it to recede into the wall. A staircase leads down into **The Tomb**.

## 5. Orphan's Mound
- A mass-burial site for those that died of the **Dawn Plague**.
- Tended by the **Gravedigger**, **Motal’s** dead are brought here and burned.
- There is a **Root Witch** here, drawn by earth-tremblings from the Rab's research.
- **Gravedigger’s Hovel**: a paltry shack just next to the mound. **Kivyer** lives there.

## 6. The Blue Forest
- A thick, moss-covered forest of spruce, fir and maple trees. The forest is quite cold.
- At night, faint blue lights guide travelers deep into the woods, where they quickly become lost.
- The lights are in fact will o’ wisps that live in the moss, and feed off anything, including flesh.

### Zina
- An **Estrie** that makes her nest in the **Blue Forest**.
- Drinks from small animals and sleeping travelers, who dream of feathers and the moon.
- Accepts offerings of bread & salt for safe passage or information, but only from villagers or those accompanying them.

## 7. Froyim’s Home
- **Froyim Greydinger** makes his home here. He is a well-respected merchant in these parts.
- Behind the unusually  modern cottage  is a small garden. A large tree sits in the Northwest corner.
- Upon arrival, the PCs will find the door smashed open and blood splattered everywhere.
- **Froyim’s** body is in the back garden, torn to shreds.
- Hiding within the tree's mossy bark is a **Shtekn Folk** spy, which will try to run away (towards **Blue Forest**).

## 8. The Sefirot
