# Backgrounds

Follow the [**Cairn Character Creation**](/cairn-srd#character-creation) as normal, but stop at **Starting Gear**.  
Then select the background you received, and roll on the requisite tables.

These backgrounds were converted from Justin Hamilton's excellent [20 Failed Careers for Knave](https://aboleth-overlords.com/2021/03/22/20-failed-careers/), which were themelves inspired by [Electric Bastionland](https://chrismcdee.itch.io/electric-bastionland).
