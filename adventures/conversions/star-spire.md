# Star Spire

- Converted from the [original work by Gus L./Ratking Productions](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/340123/Star-Spire).
- This conversion was created in Affinity Publisher from the source files, _published here with permission_.
- Download the PDF conversion [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KTCYMZxXD7YzYi9VMljPPPnHg1yg1osC/view?usp=sharing) but be sure to kick some cash to Gus as well!
- This all started when Anton Blender from the NSR Discord asked for some conversion advice. Thanks for that, Anton!
