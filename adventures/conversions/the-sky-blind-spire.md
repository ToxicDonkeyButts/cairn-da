## Introduction

**Tintardinal’s** spire was to be his grea/ work: A stone tower crafted as a giant arcanum, granting a great reward to those who unlock its secrets. Nobody knows the secrets, though, because **Tintardinal** fell to his death before he could use it.

The spire stands five stories tall, the only structure on a small island in a large lake. Now that  you've had a chance to tether your rowboat and get a close up look, you can see a great door ahead at the end of the path leading from the dock, and windows up the sides of the tower, pointing in each of the directions of the compass. The upper floor windows each seem to have a chain bolted to their sills, dangling down to the window down below (but nothing dangling from the second floor all the way to the ground). The lake is all around you, and beyond that, the scrublands you crossed to get here, mountains in the distance, and the sun just rising over the horizon to the east. The weather’s clear – it’ll be a sunny day with a clear, blue sky.

Close inspection of the shore surrounding the tower reveals small barefoot tracks in the mud going in and out, possibly from many weeks. Even closer inspection may reveal holes dug and refilled around the perimeter, with a tool buried in each.


## 1. Unwelcoming Hall

The room is filled with iron gibbets hanging on chains from a high ceiling, each with a body inside, long-decayed. **Tintardinal** likely put them here to frighten off visitors.

As you walk through the room, you see a tile on the floor ahead of you begin to glow. It’s slightly depressed, like a shallow bowl, with a bit of water in it and a large number “one” etched into the bottom. A moment later, a spark of light emerges from the glowing tile, and floats over to you, slowly orbiting your head – one for each of you in the room.

- Relic or Spellbook on one body.
- A door off its hinges leads into a hallway, straight ahead.
- Another arched doorway leads to a hallway to the left.
- Examination of the ceiling reveals it is higher than it should be, with a hole in the center, like the bottom of a refuse chute.
- From here on out, narrate the bit about the spark if they go into the correct room.
- If they go into the wrong room, note that the spark is abruptly snuffed out.
- At the one hour mark, they are no longer able to see anything blue. That means the sky too.
- Whenever they change rooms, waste time, or backtrack to regain a spark, roll a d6. On a 1, roll on the random encounter table.

## 2. Antechamber, then hallway
Through the door is an antechamber before another hall ahead. This one has a similar bowl-like tile in the middle, this time with a number “two” etched into it. It pulses with a soft glow when you enter, and another spark emerges, merging with the one above you into a slightly larger spark.

Outside the antechamber, you find yourself in a hall stretching to the left and right. Rooms line each side of the hallway, 3 on each side, and off to the right, the hallway continues into some larger room. Even from here, you can see more numbers on the floors of the smaller rooms, but it’s unclear what’s in the larger room down the hall. You can see daylight streaming in from there, and it looks like something might be moving. You hear echoes of birdlike squawking coming from that direction.

## 3. Chamber
A window on the left looks out from high above the ground. A chain bolted into the sill leads down along the outside of the spire. (**4W**)

## 4. Chamber
A window on the left looks out from high above the ground. A chain bolted into the sill leads down along the outside of the spire. (**3W**)

## 5. Chamber
There’s nothing in here but the number “five” on the floor.

## 6. Antechamber
In addition to the number “six” on the floor, there’s a staircase leading up, bending to the right.

## 7. The Fountain Room
- A large fountain with a statue stands at the center of this room.
- If they have any sparks, d6 Undines appear and attempt to reclaim them.
- If they do not have sparks, the Undines may ask them to destroy the altar.
- A Spellbook or Relic is found in the fountain, along with Plate Armor. Undines will protect them unless the group agrees to destroy the altar.
- Blue tapestry on left covers a doorway, the hallway behind it receding into darkness,
- Door on right leads to what seems like another room.
- Window on far side of the fountain has a chain.

## 8. Room
- Doorway leads straight out into room with staircase.
- Doorway leads right down stairway, into room with daylight and sounds of bird squawking.
- Hallway leads left, ending in a closed door.

## 9. Dire Pelicans’ Roost
This room stinks like a wharf and the floor is covered in mud, sticks, and bird shit. Giant dire pelicans fly in and out through the four windows lining the wall. The lighting through the windows seems odd.
- The number in the floor (**9**) is hidden beneath refuse.
- The windows are all on the 2nd floor, facing different directions.
- Exits lead to the hallway of small chambers, up a flight of stairs to Room 8, and out to another room with a door visible.

- Short hallway leads to (**12**)

## 12. Room
- Window with chain in sill looks down from high (**4S**)

## 13. Bleak Hall
This hall has two stairways with a landing in between. Four large statues are arrayed at the corners of the staircase, with offerings at their feet, as if used as idols for prayer. And a person in rusty armor appears to be standing at the top of the staircase, staring blankly off away from you, swaying uneasily.
- Dead bodies reanimate here. Save STR vs. possession if sleeping here or suffering _critical damage_.
- **Tintardinal's** spectral mentor will come if they pray. He will urge them to complete **Tintardinal**’s work, to complete the path in order and leave the altar intact.
- Exits in all directions.

### Skeleton
6 HP, 2 Armor, 10 STR, 13 DEX, 12 WIL, sword (d6).
- Shatters at 0 STR, but reforms next turn unless pieces are kept apart.
- Falls into a pile of bones if idols are destroyed, but this will summon an angry spectral mentor.

- It looks like the wall leads up a conical shaft, smaller at the top. There are handholds on the wall.
- There may be giant muck flies here.

-  Exits leading to (**20**), hallway to (**18**), window high above ground (**5W**),blue tapestry covering doorway
-  Giants are hungry and desperate, unable to leave the tower and distressed that their silver horde has shrunk. Still, they may be calmed with a WIL save by the group.
-  6 sacks of silver treasure, including a _Circlet of True-seeing_ (allows the wearer to see through the sky-blindness and spot invisible hungry spirits).

## 22. Study
A table covered in scrolls and blueprints, and bookshelves with dozens of tomes in weird languages, notes scribbled in the same handwriting over everything.
- Window with chain in sill (**4E**).
- Stairs back down to (**14**).
- Studying papers reveals many different layouts for a complicated tower design. Notes indicate there is a 24th “altar room” somewhere. It’s not clear how the rooms should be numbered, but you notice at at least one layout seems more consistently repeated across multiple maps, even circled a couple times in places. You could probably take a page with this layout and label it as you go, if you wanted.

## 23. Two-window Chamber
This chamber has two windows in the walls, each with a chain bolted onto its sill. Through the window straight ahead, you can see your rowboat tethered a few floors below. Through the one on the left, you see the lake a good five floors below, and something seems weird about the shadows on the ground compared to the other window.

## 24. Rooftop Altar
Bearing a full-sized spark to the altar completes **Tintardinal's** master spell. Lightning arcs from the lake and strikes the spark-bearer for d10 damage, ignoring armor. If they survive, they are granted a wish. After d3 wishes, the lake spirit and the Undines die, and the lake becomes gray and barren.
