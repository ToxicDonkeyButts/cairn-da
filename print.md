##### A print-to-order version is available on [Lulu](https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/yochai-gal-and-cosmic-orrery-and-jim-parkin/cairn/paperback/product-q7jgg7.html) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1329489020). The price is _at cost_. The Lulu version is slightly nicer than Amazon, and they are a cool company. Support them if you can.
